# Daemon behavior

## Introduction

This specification covers some of the daemon's behavior, such as
reaction to given signals, crashes, ...

## Startup
On every start, LXD checks that its directory structure exists. If it
doesn't, it'll create the required directories, generate a keypair and
initialize the database.

Once the daemon is ready for work, LXD will scan the containers table
for any container for which the stored power state differs from the
current one. If a container's power state was recorded as running and the
container isn't running, LXD will start it.

## Signal handling
### SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTERM
For those signals, LXD assumes that it's being temporarily stopped and
will be restarted at a later time to continue handling the containers.

The containers will keep running and LXD will close all connections and
exit cleanly.

### SIGPWR
Indicates to LXD that the host is going down.

LXD will attempt a clean shutdown of all the containers. After 30s, it
will kill any remaining container.

The container `power_state` in the containers table is kept as it was so
that LXD after the host is done rebooting can restore the containers as
they were.

### SIGUSR1
Write a memory profile dump to the file specified with `--memprofile`.
